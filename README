--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Growl provides a facility for notifying events through Growl
using the Mac::Growl module as back-end. Integration with POE's architecture
allows easy, non-blocking notifications.

------------
Requirements
------------

POE::Component::Growl requires POE and Mac::Growl.
Installing it with the CPAN shell should cause it to do the right thing 
with regards to these dependencies.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Growl may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual manner.  Typically:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Growl'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Growl

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Growl

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This module may also be installed manually.  Its distribution is
available from the author's CPAN directory,
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/A/AA/AAR/>, or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The test program will build a POE application and send you a notification
through Growl.

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.

Thanks for reading!
